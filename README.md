# PyRamanujan
A python implementation for constructing Ramanujan subspace(RS) dictionary. The code constructs a Ramanujan subspace (truncated) dictionary used for source separation.

## Usage
Due to the inefficiency of current implementation, it is recommended that compute the RS only one time and store it in memory.

A simple demonstration is executed by running the file(RamaSpace.py) directly.
